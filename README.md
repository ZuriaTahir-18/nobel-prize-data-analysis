This repository contains an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project on Nobel Prize winners. The analysis provides insights into the distribution of laureates across different categories, countries, and genders over the years.

## Project Objectives

* Explore the Nobel Prize dataset
* Analyze trends by year, gender, and country
* Identify category-wise patterns
* Visualize findings using Python libraries

## Files

* `nobel_prize_eda.ipynb`: Main notebook containing the EDA.

## Tools & Libraries

* Python
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn

## Dataset

The Nobel Prize dataset was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nobelfoundation/nobel-laureates).
